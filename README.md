🎬 Movie Data Analysis with DBT
A modular, scalable analytics project using S3 → Snowflake → DBT → Power BI, tailored for media industry use cases (e.g., Netflix), with additional adaptation scenarios for the insurance domain.

🛠️ Tool-by-Tool Deep Dive
1. Amazon S3 – Staging Layer
Purpose: Landing zone for raw CSVs (e.g., Netflix or MovieLens data).

Business Role: Functions as a data lake to capture structured/semi-structured logs — user activity, movie metadata, ratings.

Scalability: Decouples storage and compute; ideal for archival and historical replay of raw events.

2. Snowflake – Cloud Data Warehouse
Role: Ingests raw data from S3 into RAW schema tables.

Performance: Supports columnar storage, elastic scalability, and semi-structured formats (like JSON).

Business Value: Provides a single source of truth for customer analytics — churn prediction, engagement metrics, and recommendation engine tuning.

3. DBT (Data Build Tool) – Core Transformation Engine
🔹 Models – SQL Logic Layer
Staging Models (stg_*): Normalize names, formats; light cleaning (null removal, type casting).

Intermediate Models (int_*): Join logic across domains — users + ratings, movies + tags.

Mart Models (dim_*, fct_*): Final reporting-ready tables.

🔹 Snapshots
Tracks Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) (e.g., user location or subscription changes).

Business Use: Enables time-based analysis — comparing data “as it was known” historically.

🔹 Tests
Built-in: not_null, unique, accepted_values.

Custom: E.g., Ensure all rated movies exist in the movie table.

Governance Benefit: Enforces data contracts — vital in regulated domains.

🔹 Seeds & Sources
Seeds: Static lookup/reference tables (e.g., genre mappings).

Sources: Define raw Snowflake tables originating from S3.

🔹 Documentation
Auto-generates DAGs and lineage graphs.

Enables traceability and debugging through clear dependency mapping.

🔹 Macros (Jinja Templates)
Encourages DRY practices (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Example: Reusable current_timestamp() function.

Business Use: Consistency across large-scale, multi-tenant models.

4. Power BI / Looker Studio – Visualization Layer
Connects to DBT’s final models (dim_, fct_) to generate:

🔥 Heatmaps of top-rated genres

🌍 Watch-time comparisons across countries

📊 Active user cohorts and rating behavior

Media Business Insights:

Personalized content tuning

Subscriber retention strategies

Evaluation of content performance

📊 Business Use Cases
🎥 Streaming / Media Domain (e.g., Netflix)
Churn Prediction: Behavioral drift tracked via snapshots.

Recommendation Engine Tuning: Use tags/ratings to optimize algorithms.

Content Analytics: Identify high-performing actors, genres, and regions.

Geo Analytics: Regional breakdowns guide localization strategies.

🏦 Adaptation for Insurance Sector
Policy Change Tracking: Use SCD snapshots to monitor plan upgrades or beneficiary edits.

Claims Analysis: DBT models help assess average settlement times and flag potential fraud.

Customer Segmentation: Power BI insights by age, risk profile, or policy type.

Regulatory Reporting: DBT tests ensure integrity and compliance (e.g., IRDAI norms).

🧠 Architectural Principles Reinforced
ELT (Extract → Load → Transform): Leverages Snowflake's compute power for transformations.

Modularity: Organized SQL models for maintainability.

Data Contracts: Enforced via tests, snapshots, and clear documentation.

DevOps for Analytics: Git-based workflows, CI/CD for data models — aligns with modern engineering practices.
